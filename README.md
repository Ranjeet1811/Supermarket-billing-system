# Supermarket-billing-system
I have created three directory 
1. repositiory (read_data python) 
2. controller (get price python file)
3. services (caluclate price python file)
4. main .py file (main file where we can run code

In this billing system i am taking input what items  required custome and how much quntity 
after that we are callculate the price 
and display your total ammount with item name and qunatity 


In respositiory i am reading data
In services we are callculate the price using some logic 
In controller we are controlling all the function what  fuction which should be exceute 
In all directory whe have created one python files each file is connected to other one 
and the last main.py file where we can run all the function by one function call
